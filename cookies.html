                        In compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we provide clear information about our use of cookies and obtain your consent before setting non-essential cookies. You have the right to access, rectify, or erase your personal data, and the right to restrict or object to our processing of your personal data. Our cookie consent management solution helps automate GDPR compliance by recording user consent preferences and providing audit trails. For EU residents, we do not load any non-essential cookies before obtaining explicit consent. We also honor "Do Not Track" signals in browsers that support this feature, though this doesn't necessarily prevent all tracking.

                        For California residents under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), we provide notice at collection about the categories of personal information collected through cookies and tracking technologies. The CCPA provides California residents with the right to opt-out of the "sale" of their personal information, which may include certain uses of cookies for personalized advertising. Our "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" link allows California residents to opt-out of tracking by advertising cookies. We do not discriminate against users who exercise their CCPA rights. We disclose in our Privacy Policy the categories of third parties with whom we share cookie data and the purposes of sharing.

                    <p class="text-gray-600">
                        Strictly necessary cookies are essential for you to navigate the website and use its features. These cookies allow the website to remember your actions as you move between pages (like maintaining items in your shopping cart) or during a single visit (like maintaining a logged-in session). These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information and are typically session-based. Without these cookies, the services you've asked for cannot be provided, and some parts of the website will not function properly. Examples include authentication cookies, load-balancing cookies, and security cookies. While you can disable these cookies through browser settings, doing so may significantly affect website functionality.

                    <p class="text-gray-600">
                        We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of cookies we use. Secure cookies (transmitted over encrypted HTTPS connections) are used for sensitive operations like authentication. We utilize SameSite cookie attributes to help prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. For cookies that store sensitive information like session tokens, we set HTTP-only flags to prevent client-side script access. Our cookies use secure and HttpOnly flags where appropriate, and we implement proper cookie scope restrictions. We also regularly audit our cookie usage to identify and eliminate any unnecessary or excessive cookies.

                        We categorize cookies based on their function and purpose to help you understand and manage your preferences: Strictly Necessary (essential for website operation), Performance (help us understand how visitors interact with our site), Functional (enhance your experience by remembering preferences), and Targeting (used by advertising networks to deliver relevant ads). Each category of cookies serves different purposes and has different privacy implications. Our cookie consent tool allows you to enable or disable each category individually. Disabling certain categories may affect different aspects of your website experience, from functionality to personalization and content relevance.

                        Social media cookies are set by social media platforms when you interact with social media widgets or buttons on our website. These cookies may track your browsing habits even when you don't interact with the widget. Social media cookies enable you to share content with your networks ("share" buttons), help implement social media functionality (like comment sections), or facilitate social media advertising. Examples include Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn cookies. These cookies may be used to track your visits to other websites and build a profile of your interests, which may impact the content and messages you see on other sites.

                        Unlike regular browser cookies, Flash cookies (also known as Local Shared Objects or LSOs) are data files that can be stored on your computer by websites that use Adobe Flash. Flash cookies can hold more data than regular cookies and aren't managed through your browser in the same way. They can survive browser cookie deletion and can be used to recreate deleted browser cookies. Our website does not currently use Flash cookies, as Flash technology is being phased out across the web. If we ever implement Flash cookies in the future, we will update this policy and provide appropriate controls. To manage Flash cookies, you would need to adjust your Adobe Flash Player settings.

                    <p class="text-gray-600">
                        Zombie cookies are cookies that are automatically recreated after a user has deleted them, typically using various storage mechanisms like Flash cookies, HTML5 storage, and other client-side storage options. These types of cookies are controversial as they circumvent user expectations about cookie deletion. Our website does not use zombie cookies or any mechanisms to recreate deleted cookies without user consent. We believe in transparent cookie practices and respecting user privacy choices. All cookies we set respect user deletion requests through standard browser controls. We regularly audit our cookie practices to ensure compliance with this policy and applicable privacy laws.

                        Some third parties may have access to cookies set by our website for legitimate purposes. This includes our analytics providers (like Google Analytics), advertising networks, and social media platforms who may set cookies through our site. These third parties are contractually obligated to use the cookie data only for the purposes we specify and in accordance with applicable laws. We disclose in our Privacy Policy which categories of third parties might access cookie data.

                        In addition to our cookie consent tool, several industry initiatives offer ways to control certain types of cookies: The Digital Advertising Alliance's opt-out page helps users opt-out of interest-based advertising; the Network Advertising Initiative provides an opt-out tool for NAI member companies; and Google offers an Ads Settings page to control Google's personalized ads. For analytics cookies, you can install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on. These opt-out mechanisms typically work by placing an "opt-out cookie" on your device that tells the respective  service not to track your activity. However, opting out may limit your ability to use certain features of our website or other sites that rely on cookies for functionality.
